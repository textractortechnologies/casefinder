Hi Mike,

These are the fields of the input document:

LAST_NAME
FIRST_NAME
MIDDLE_NAME
PAT_MRN_ID
SSN
BIRTH_DATE
ADDR_LINE_1
ADDR_LINE_2
CITY
STATE_CODE
ZIP_CODE
HOME_PHONE
GENDER_CODE
ENC_DATE
ORD_RES_COMP_COMMENT

I'm thinking these will all be text fields in an Excel spreadsheet. Is that workable for you?

The ORD_RES_COMP_COMMENT field contains the text of the pathology note.
