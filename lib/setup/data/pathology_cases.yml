    A, B, C & D. Left thalamic lesion, biopsy and resection:
    ?	Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV, see comment.
    ?	MGMT gene methylation test ordered; see separate molecular report for result.
    ?	Sequencing of IDH1/2 ordered; see separate molecular report for result.
    Comment:
    This is a highly cellular tumor composed of highly atypical cells with astrocytic cytologic features. There is no oligodendroglial component. The mitotic index is 20/10 high-power fields. There are microvascular proliferation and tumor necrosis. MIB-1 proliferation index is 25% (Block C1). P53 immunolabeling index is about 5% and the staining intensity is moderate. Immunostain for IDH1 performed on C1 is negative for tumor cells. Immunostain for GFAP is positive, which is consistent with a glial neoplasm. Immunostain for neurofilament confirms that the tumor is infiltrating.

    The positive controls demonstrate appropriate positive staining. The known tissue negative controls were negative. The non-immune serum control was non-reactive.

    A. Left breast, mass at 12:00 and 1 cm from the nipple, ultrasound core needle biopsy (BIRADS 5):
    ?	Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2 (3+2+1), 0.7 cm in maximum dimension (see note).

    B. Left breast, mass at 11:00 and 2 cm from the nipple, ultrasound core needle biopsy (BIRADS 5):
    ?	Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), nuclear grade 2, cribriform and solid types, with lobular extension and microcalcifications.

    Note for part A: The immunohistochemical breast panel has been ordered and the results will be reported in an addendum. This case was reviewed at the Intradepartmental Quality Assurance Conference and those present concur with the above diagnosis.

    Thingumy and Bob: Inseparable twins, with their own funny language, which a Hemulen deciphers, consisting largely of spoonerisms and similar inversions of words and syllables. Moomin eventually gets the hang of it, while Sniff thinks they are speaking a foreign language. They like to hide in small places, but to others it is not always clear what they are up to. They do not know what is theirs and steal Moominmama’s handbag to live in, which they soon return when they realise how much she needs it. The ruby they stole is, however not returned to the groke at all. They swap the ruby for another ruby with the Hobgoblin (Finn Family Moomintroll).

    The Groke: A ghost-shaped creature that scares everyone, she says nothing (she growls) and the ground freezes below her. The other characters are afraid of her, but she is just simply very lonely. The Groke is also attracted to fire, but when she sees it and sits on it, the fire will extinguish.

    Stinky: A small furry creature that always plays jokes on the family in the house, where he sometimes lives. He likes pinching things, is proud of his reputation as a crook, but always gets found out. He is simple and only thinks of himself.

    The Muddler (Moomins): Living in a coffee tin, this anxious collector stores away all the buttons he finds, but his carelessness with the collection makes him lose and forget things. The Fuzzy is the Muddler’s wife, whom he met on an adventure with Moominpappa. Sniff is their child, but he lives with the Moomins.

    Biographical interpretation[edit]
    Critics have interpreted various Moomin characters as being inspired by real people, especially members of the author's family, and Tove Jansson spoke in interviews about the backgrounds of, and possible models for, her characters.[4]

    Tove Jansson's life partner was the graphic artist Tuulikki Pietilä, whose personality inspired the character Too-Ticky in Moominland Midwinter.[4][5] Moomintroll and Little My have been seen as psychological self-portraits of the artist.[4][5] The Moomins, generally speaking, relate strongly to Jansson's own family – they were bohemian, lived close to nature and were very tolerant towards diversity.[4][5][6] Moominpappa and Moominmamma are often seen as portraits of Jansson's parents Viktor Jansson and Signe Hammarsten-Jansson.[4][5][6] Most of Jansson's characters are on the verge of melancholy, such as the always formal Hemulen, or the strange Hattifatteners, who travel in concerted, ominous groups. Jansson uses the differences between the characters' philosophies to provide a venue for her satirical impulses.[7]
