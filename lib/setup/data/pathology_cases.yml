    A, B, C & D. Left thalamic lesion, biopsy and resection:
    ?	Glioblastoma, WHO grade IV, see comment.
    ?	MGMT gene methylation test ordered; see separate molecular report for result.
    ?	Sequencing of IDH1/2 ordered; see separate molecular report for result.
    Comment:
    This is a highly cellular tumor composed of highly atypical cells with astrocytic cytologic features. There is no oligodendroglial component. The mitotic index is 20/10 high-power fields. There are microvascular proliferation and tumor necrosis. MIB-1 proliferation index is 25% (Block C1). P53 immunolabeling index is about 5% and the staining intensity is moderate. Immunostain for IDH1 performed on C1 is negative for tumor cells. Immunostain for GFAP is positive, which is consistent with a glial neoplasm. Immunostain for neurofilament confirms that the tumor is infiltrating.

    The positive controls demonstrate appropriate positive staining. The known tissue negative controls were negative. The non-immune serum control was non-reactive.

    A. Left breast, mass at 12:00 and 1 cm from the nipple, ultrasound core needle biopsy (BIRADS 5):
    ?	Invasive ductal carcinoma, grade 2 (3+2+1), 0.7 cm in maximum dimension (see note).

    B. Left breast, mass at 11:00 and 2 cm from the nipple, ultrasound core needle biopsy (BIRADS 5):
    ?	Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), nuclear grade 2, cribriform and solid types, with lobular extension and microcalcifications.

    Note for part A: The immunohistochemical breast panel has been ordered and the results will be reported in an addendum. This case was reviewed at the Intradepartmental Quality Assurance Conference and those present concur with the above diagnosis.
